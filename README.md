### Hi.

I'm currently working on a variety of Zig projects:
- [http.zig](https://github.com/karlseguin/http.zig) - An HTTP/1.1 server
- [websocket.zig](https://github.com/karlseguin/websocket.zig) - A websocket server
- [logz.zig](https://github.com/karlseguin/log.zig) - Structured logger
- [zqlite.zig](https://github.com/karlseguin/zqlite.zig) - A thin wrapper for sqlite
- [zuckdb.zig](https://github.com/karlseguin/zuckdb.zig) - A thin wrapper for duckdb
- [validate.zig](https://github.com/karlseguin/validate.zig) - A validation library
- [cache.zig](https://github.com/karlseguin/cache.zig) - Thread-safe, expiration-aware, LRU cache
- [pondz](https://github.com/pondzdev/pondz) - WIP DuckDB query API


I also have a few Elixir libraries you might find useful:
- [exws](https://github.com/karlseguin/exws) - A minimalist Websocket server for Elixir (+ [channel library](https://github.com/karlseguin/exws_channels))
- [dcache](https://github.com/karlseguin/dcache) - A fast caching library for Elixir

And a few low-friction services:
- [goblgobl/assets](https://github.com/goblgobl/assets) - A performance-focused static asset proxy
- [goblgobl/authen](https://github.com/goblgobl/authen) - An authentication enhancement service

My most popular repos are:
- [ccache](https://github.com/karlseguin/ccache) - An LRU caching library for Go
- [the-little-go-book](https://github.com/karlseguin/the-little-go-book) - The Little Go Book
- [the-little-redis-book](https://github.com/karlseguin/the-little-redis-book) - The Little Redis Book
