### Hi.

I'm currently taking a gap year (or two, or three), but I'm open to hearing about interesting remote opportunities (I'm in GMT +8)

#### I'm currently working on:
- [karlseguin/exws](https://github.com/karlseguin/exws) - A minimalist Websocket server for Elixir
- [goblgobl/authen](https://github.com/goblgobl/authen) - An authentication enhancement service


#### My most popular repos are:
- [karlseguin/ccache](https://github.com/karlseguin/ccache) - An LRU caching library for Go
- [karlseguin/the-little-go-book](https://github.com/karlseguin/the-little-go-book) - The Little Go Book
- [karlseguin/the-little-redis-book](https://github.com/karlseguin/the-little-redis-book) - The Little Redis Book
